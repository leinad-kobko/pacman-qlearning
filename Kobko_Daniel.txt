Part A

200 training episodes are preferred. 

When testing on my laptop these were the statistics of my last run:
 - Map: Medium Classic
 - Training Rounds: 200
 - Total Rounds: 300
 - Average Training Time (per 100): 60 seconds
 - Average Rewards: 1415.16
 - Average Score: 1838.17
 - Winrate: 92/100 (92%)

 - Map: Medium Grid
 - Training Rounds: 200
 - Total Rounds: 300
 - Average Training Time (per 100): 2 seconds
 - Average Rewards: 464.65
 - Average Score: 527.32
 - Winrate: 100/100 (100%)

After running SimpleExtractor, I found the following inefficiencies with simple Pacman:
 - Pacman only cares about the closest food. Does not care about capsules or nearby scared ghosts.
 - Even if a scared ghost is in front of Pacman, he will avoid them
 - Pacman will sometimes stay still

The Pacman extractor I designed is made with the intention of being used on "general purpose" maps.
It performs well on maps like mediumClassic, and will have a low winrate, but high score on trickier 
maps like trickyClassic.

Some of the new features added to raise Pacman's average score:
Pacman seeks out capsules while there are angry ghosts so as to maximize the score gained
from eating scared ghosts more. If a scared ghost is close enough, or in lots of food, 
Pacman will seek it, raising the average score. Pacman tries to keep moving and not STOP 
so as to not lose score to standing idle.Pacman is fearful of how close he is to angry ghosts
making him try to go for food more distant from angry ghosts.

All Features:
 - can't stop
 - eats ghost
 - eats food
 - eats capsule
 - avoid capsule
 - closest capsule
 - closest food
 - closest scared ghost
 - closest angry ghost
 - # of angry ghosts 1 step away

Part B
------

For my layout I wanted to take the most advantage of my ability to seek capsules and seek
scared ghosts. The capsule at the start is out of the way and my agent seeks/eats it. The simple
agent would not eat it unless a ghost forces it to move into one. After my agent eats the capsule, 
it immediately eats the two ghosts raising its score considerably. The simple agent would fear the 
scared ghosts and still run away. I took advantage of the simple agent's fear and made the paths narrow, 
forcing the simple agent to backtrack through the map, whereas my agent would just eat the ghosts and
move on. Even if the simple agent manages to survive, it finishes with a much lower score than my agent, 
whereas my agent will almost always finish with a score of 983 and a 100% winrate.
